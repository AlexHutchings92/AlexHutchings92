- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Hutchings. I have a background in architectural design, and am expanding my skill set to software engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in web design, and desktop apps. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS, and want to learn C++ or C# afterward to make desktop & mobile apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to (eventually) collaborate on an architectural program better than AutoCAD or ArchiCAD.
- 📫 My e-mail is alexhutchings92@gmail.com
